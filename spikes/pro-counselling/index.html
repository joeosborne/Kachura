  <ol class="MethodWrapper">
    <li>
      Heat the oven to 220&deg;C (or gas mark 7). Tip the flour
      into a large bowl along with the salt and baking powder,
      then mix it all up. Add the butter in, then rub the butter
      in with your fingers until the mix looks like fine crumbs.
      When that is done, stir in the sugar.
    </li>
    <li>
      Put the milk into a jug and heat in the microwave for about
      20-30 seconds. It should be warm but not hot. Add the
      vanilla and lemon juice to the milk and then put that to one
      side and but a baking tray in the oven to warm.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make a well in the dry mix, then add the liquid and combine
      it quickly with a cutlery knife – it will seem pretty wet at
      first. Spread some flour onto the work surface and tip the
      dough out. Dredge the dough and your hands with a little
      more flour, then fold the dough over 2-3 times until it's
      smoother. Now pat it into a round shape about 4cm deep.
    </li>
    <li>
      Take a 5cm cutter (Pro-tip – smooth-edged cutters tend to
      cut more cleanly, giving a better rise) and dip it into some
      flour. Plunge into the dough, then repeat until you have
      four scones. By this point you’ll probably need to press
      what's left of the dough back into a round to cut out
      another four.
    </li>
    <li>
      Brush the tops with beaten egg, then place onto the hot
      baking tray.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake for 10 minutes until risen and golden on the top. Eat
      just warm or cold on the day of baking, generously (and I do
      mean generously) topped with jam and clotted cream.
    </li>
    <li>
      If freezing, freeze once cool. Defrost, then put in a low
      oven (about 160&deg;C) for a few minutes to refresh.
    </li>
